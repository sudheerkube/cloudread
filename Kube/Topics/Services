Services:

  - Helps in connecting across Services

  - External Communication : 

     -  NodePort: Service makes internal pod port accessible on Node
         consists of TargetPort, Port, NodePort ( only valid range)
        
     -  CLusterIP: Creates a virtual IP to create communicatin across groups of pods, No External access 
           
     -  Loadbalancer:  the standard way to expose a service to the internet. On GKE, this will spin up a Network Load Balancer that will give you a single IP address 
                 that will forward all traffic to your service

     - Ingress:  Ingress is actually NOT a type of service. Instead, it sits in front of multiple services and act as a “smart router” or entrypoint into your cluster
                The default GKE ingress controller will spin up a HTTP(S) Load Balancer for you. This will let you do both path based and subdomain based routing to backend services
