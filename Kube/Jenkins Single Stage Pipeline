Add a slave node named Storage Server. It should be labeled as ststor01 and 
its remote root directory should be /home/natasha.

We have already cloned repository on Storage Server under /home/sarah/web_app.
 Update the content of the file index.html under the same repository to Welcome to Nautilus Group! and push the changes to the origin into master branch.

Apache is already installed on all app Servers its running on port 5002.

Create a Jenkins pipeline job named nautilus-webapp-job (it must not be a Multibranch pipeline) and 
configure it to:

a. Deploy the code from web_app repository under /data on Storage Server, as this location is already mounted to the document root /var/www/html of app servers. The pipeline should have a single stage named Deploy ( which is case sensitive )
 to accomplish the deployment.
