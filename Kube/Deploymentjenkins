Install httpd (whatever version is available in the yum repo by default) and 
configure it to serve on port 5000 on All App servers. 
You can make it part of your Jenkins job or you can do this step manually on all app servers.

sudo yum install httpd -y 
sudo sed -i 's/Listen 80/Listen /g' /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
sudo systemctl start httpd



Create a Jenkins job named nautilus-app-deployment and configure it in a way that
 if anyone pushes any new change to the origin repository on master branch the job should auto build and 
 deploy the latest code on Storage server under /data directory. Since /data on Storage server is a NFS mount, 
 changes should auto reflect on all apps.





SSH into Storage Server using sarah user credentials mentioned above. 
Under sarah user's home you will find a cloned Git repository named web.
Under this repository there is an index.html file, update its content to Welcome to the xFusionCorp Industries and 
then push the changes to the origin into master branch. This push must trigger your Jenkins job and the 
2az3aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa3latest changes must be deployed also make sure it deploys the entire 
repository content not only index.html file.
