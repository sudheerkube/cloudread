 Architecure Model:
       - 3-subscription architecture
       - RBAC 
       - Azure tagging will be enforced for chargeback purposes
       - Azure Subscription Management (ASM) supports high-level management of the Azure Subscription.
         When an Azure Subscription is created (Azure Service Account), an Azure Service Administrator is assigned.


Subscription Model: 
-  Enterprise enrollment -> depts (optional) -> Account -> Subscription 

Roles in Subscription Management - 

- Enterprise Administrator -> Enterprise Enrolment -> Top level controls accounts, account owners, usage and billing.
- Account Owner -> account -> Create and manage subscriptions, only the Account Owner can perform these functions 
Manage Service Admin and Co-Adminis View usage for subscriptions,View charges – if EA has provided access.
- Service Administrator -> Subscription -> Access and manage subscriptions and developmprojects on the develop portal
- subscriptions owner -> Access and manage subscriptions and development projects on the developer portal

Azure Subscription Modelling - Production, Dev, QA/Test

Azure Naming Convention -> <ResourceType>|<LocationCode>|<Environment+Numeric> 
  - Storage Account Names must be unique across Azure, not just Micron subscriptions
  - Storage Table Name must be unique within Azure subscription account
  - Search Service and Virtual machines are constrained 2 to 15 characters
  - Storage Account Name cannot have dash, dots, etc
  - Storage account names must be all lower case

High availability: 
Azure Gateways -> Gateways will be implemented with high availability in an active/passive design. 
              When an Azure Gateway is created, a second Gateway is automatically created by Azure.

Azure ExpressRoute -> consists of two connections to two Microsoft Enterprise edge routers (MSEEs)
                       from connectivity provider / your network edge.

Azure Traffic Manager -> HA in an active/passive design. Azure tm is created, 
                         a second tm is automatically created by Azure.

Azure Load balancer -> -do-

Network: 
 ExpressRoute -> Private peering connections to customer virtual networks and 
      Microsoft peering connection to Microsoft services like Office 365
    and Skype and any Azure public services (PaaS)
  - Connection speed - ranges from 50 Mbps to 10 Gbps
  - Peering location - Depens on provider
  - ExpressRoute gateways come in three configurations -> Std (1gbs), high (2),ultra(9)


Virtual Networks -> building block for establishing nw, Virtual networks are containers for subnets and gateway, 

User Defined Routes -> assign routes that override the default implicit system routes, ExpressRoute BGP advertised
 routes, or the local-site network-defined routes for S2S connections.Configuring a user defined route allows 
 the specification of next-hop definition rules that control traffic flow within a subnet, between subnets,
  from a subnet through an appliance to another subnet, to the Internet, and to on-premises networks.

 Implicit System Routes -> 

 Routing of traffic from a virtual machine is accomplished by using implicit system routing via a distributed router
  that is implemented at the virtual network level. Every packet follows a set of implicit routes that are 
  implemented at the host level. These routes control the flow of traffic within the virtual network to on-premises
networks (if enabled), and to the Internet. Traffic flow to the Internet is achieved through NAT by the host


  User Defined Routing with Virtual Appliances -> 

  If the user-defined routing is defined with NextHopType VNETLocal routing, 
  route to a virtual machine in the virtual network, based on address.
 VPNGateway routing, route to a machine on-premises, based on address.
 VirtualAppliance routing, route to the virtual appliance, based on address.
  Internet routing, route to the Internet over the host NAT

  Network Security Groups -> control traffic to one or more virtual machine instances in a virtual network. Network Security Groups are like firewall rules
   in that they provide the ability to control the inbound and outbound traffic to a subnet, a virtual machine,
    or virtual network adapter.
    - NSG limits :  100 region/per subscription, 1 for subnet,vm, adapter, 100 rules


 Storage: 
      GPV1->
   - A Standard storage performance tier which allows you to store Tables, Queues, Files, Blobs and Azure virtual machine disks. 
    This tier is hosted on Hard Disk Drives (HDD)

    - A Premium storage performance tier which currently only supports Azure virtual machine disks.
    This tier is hosted on Solid State Drives (SSD).
       GPV2->

        - Types: Blob (block,page), table, Queue, File.
        Blob: 3 tier -> hot,cold and archieve.
     
     -  Storage Security: Azure authentication and Storage account key 

        - Locally redundant storage : 3 copies locally 
        - Zone-redundant storage : 3 copies Supports one region failure
        - Geo-redundant storage : Six copies, data is durable in 3 regions
        - Read-access geo-redundant storage : Read only access in the second region

        Premium Storage: P10-p50: Is local only, Snapshot and GRS 

        - Managed Disks - 0,000 VM disks in a subscription, which will enable you to create thousands of VMs 
         in a single subscription.

Virtual Machines : 
   - availability set: Fault Domains and update domain

    - Azure disk encryption -> Azure Key Vault service -> BitLocker for Windows VM Disks and DMCrypt for Linux VM disks

    - 

PAAS (Platform as a service): 

- Azure Cosmos DB 
-   Azure Events hub 
      - Event producers,Partitions,Consumer groups, Throughput units,Event receivers 
- Azure Search 
-   Azure App Service – Web Apps
- Azure SQL Database
- Azure Automation

- Azure Resource Locking
